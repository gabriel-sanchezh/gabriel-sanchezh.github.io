I’m an MSc student in Economics at [Heidelberg University](https://www.awi.uni-heidelberg.de/en), specializing in macroeconomics and financial econometrics. I hold a BSc in Economics from the [University of Costa Rica](https://economia.ucr.ac.cr/), where I served as teaching assistant and worked as a research assistant at the [Economic Sciences Research Institute (IICE)](https://iice.ucr.ac.cr/).

My research interests include macroeconomics, monetary policy, econometrics, and finance.
