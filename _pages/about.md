Welcome to my website. I am a student and teaching assistant in the [Department of Economics](https://economia.ucr.ac.cr/es) at [Universidad de Costa Rica](https://www.ucr.ac.cr/). Additionally, I work as a research assistant at [IICE](https://iice.ucr.ac.cr/).

I have a wide range of interests that include finance, data analysis, econometrics, and public policies. On my website, I share insights and experiences related to these interests. Please do not hesitate to reach out to me for any inquiries or collaborations.
