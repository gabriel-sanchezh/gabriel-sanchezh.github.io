I’m an MSc student in Economics at [Heidelberg University](https://www.awi.uni-heidelberg.de/en), specializing in macroeconomics and financial econometrics. I hold a BSc in Economics from the [University of Costa Rica](https://economia.ucr.ac.cr/), where I served as teaching assistant and worked as a research assistant at the [Economic Sciences Research Institute (IICE)](https://iice.ucr.ac.cr/), studying fiscal policy, labor markets, and monetary policy’s effects on inequality.

My research interests include macroeconomics, econometrics, and finance. One example is my study on inflation regimes in Latin America, available [here](/research/bayesianregimes). I’ve also worked in public policy and the financial sector, applying quantitative methods to support economic and strategic decisions.
