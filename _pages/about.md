I am a master’s student in Economics at [Heidelberg University](https://www.awi.uni-heidelberg.de/en), with a focus on macroeconomics and financial econometrics.

My academic background includes a bachelor’s degree in economics from the [University of Costa Rica](https://economia.ucr.ac.cr/), where I served as a teaching assistant for International Macroeconomics, Public Economics, and Econometrics for undergraduates. I also worked as a research assistant at the [Economic Sciences Research Institute (IICE)](https://iice.ucr.ac.cr/), contributing to empirical projects on fiscal policy, labor markets, and the impact of monetary policy on inequality.

My academic interests lie in macroeconomics, econometrics, and finance. An example of this agenda is my study on inflation regimes in the Latin American region, which can be found [here](/research/bayesianregimes).

I have experience in both the public and private sectors: I have advised on public policy and legislation, and held data-focused roles in the financial industry, applying quantitative methods to support economic and strategic decision-making.
