Welcome to my website. I am an economist graduated from the [University of Costa Rica](https://www.ucr.ac.cr/). Currently, I work as a data specialist at [Moody's](https://moodys.com/).

My wide range of interests include econometrics, macroeconomics, and finance. On my website, I share insights and experiences related to these interests.
