**About EconCR24** On December 17, 2024, the IV Costa Rica Economists Conference took place at the University of Costa Rica (UCR). Featured speakers included Marcela Eslava (Universidad de Los Andes) on business development in Latin America and Pascual Restrepo (Yale University) on automation and inequality.

This edition introduced an academic poster session for undergraduate research and included 12 parallel sessions on monetary policy, labor markets, and environmental economics.

Organized by UCR and the Central Bank of Costa Rica, the event continues to be a key platform for economic analysis and networking.
